### 0.10.1
##### August 1st, 2018

#### :bug: Bugfixes

[#67]: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets/pull/67


### 0.10.0
##### August 1st, 2018

#### :tada: New Features

- Scan `--all-files` option ([#57])
- Yaml inline whitelisting support ([#50])

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- Changed `--audit` and `--scan` to `audit` and `scan` ([#51])

#### :telescope: Precision

- Reduced false-positives caused by sequential strings, e.g. `ABCDEF` ([#64])

#### :bug: Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where the pre-commit code would remove the `is_secret` attribute from
  audited baselines ([#65])
- Fixed an `audit` bug where we would crash if a file in the baseline did not exist
  ([#56])
- Improved the `audit` functionality to handle short files better ([#48])

### 0.9.1
##### June 28th, 2018

#### :bug: Bugfixes

- Fixed numbering system with interactive audit
- Fixed "leapfrog" edge case for audit functionality ([#47])


[#47]: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets/pull/47


### 0.9.0
##### June 27th, 2018

#### :tada: New Features

- Added ability to migrate baselines from an older version to a newer version
- Added functionality to audit baseline, to distinguish difference between
  false and true positives in the baseline file ([#44])
- Upgraded `PrivateKeyPlugin`: more search parameters, more lines searched,
  and secret hash created using payload (rather than the entire line content)

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

- Differentiate between `Base64HighEntropyStrings` and `HexHighEntropyStrings` through
  `secret_type` ([#26])
- Got rid of `SensitivityValues` as a means to store plugin configs

#### :telescope: Precision

- Improved the heuristic for `HexHighEntropyStrings`, reducing the false positive rates
  for large numbers identified in code

#### :bug: Bugfixes

- Baseline always outputs in sorted order now, to prevent unnecessary diffs ([#25])
- Escape exclude regex statements before compilation ([#39])
- Fixed case where details of plugins used were not included in the baseline,
  when the pre-commit hook updated it ([#40])

#### :snake: Miscellaneous

- Simplified logging by removing `CustomLog` ([#46])
